Partly Hackathon 2025 - Sun 27th July 2025

# Theme

We have presented you with **four different challenges** that you can choose to tackle.

These are difficult problems to solve. In fact, they are ones we are trying to solve right now at Partly. We don’t expect you to have a perfect solution in an afternoon. Feel free to have some fun with the ideas—remember, you don’t have to build a solution that solves every problem!

**You can use any technology / method to prototype and present your project.** We have also given you access to a subset of our APIs to give you real-life data you can work with.
